## DIY Breadboard Compatibility
---



ESPHome / Home Assistant:
Use yaml for breadboard with options for setting screen size/type (round 1.28" or square 2.4" as used in the speakerbox makerworld project).

Xiaozhi AI:
Using same pins will also be compatible with the Xiaozhi firmware for breadboard. (with minor modification of 1 file, but that's another topic)

Connections:
